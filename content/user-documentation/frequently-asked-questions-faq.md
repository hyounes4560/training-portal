## [Template Searches](keyword-search.md)

### 1. My template returns no results - why?

All templates should return results with the default values provided. Please [Contact Us](contact-us.md) if you find any template that doesnâ€™t.

* If you have entered your desired values and the template returns No Results in the results preview window, this means the data you are looking for is not available.
* For more complex searches with optional constraints, the way the search is constructed may affect the results - some of the required data might be missing resulting in no results. If you have activated multiple optional constraints, it is often a good idea to turn these On individually to see if one of them is causing the problem. By default adding a constraint means that the data **MUST** satisfy that constraint for the search to return results - take a look at [Outer Joins](https://flymine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/query-builder/Documentationquerybuilder.html#outerjoin) for more details about how constraints and joins can limit your results.
