## [Template Searches](https://user-documentation-intermine.gitbook.io/user-documentation/content/user-documentation/keyword-search)

### 1. My template returns no results - why?

All templates should return results with the default values provided. Please [Contact Us](contact-us.md) if you find any template that doesnâ€™t.

* If you have entered your desired values and the template returns No Results in the results preview window, this means the data you are looking for is not available.
* For more complex searches with optional constraints, the way the search is constructed may affect the results - some of the required data might be missing resulting in no results. If you have activated multiple optional constraints, it is often a good idea to turn these On individually to see if one of them is causing the problem. By default adding a constraint means that the data **MUST** satisfy that constraint for the search to return results - take a look at [Outer Joins](https://flymine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/query-builder/Documentationquerybuilder.html#outerjoin) for more details about how constraints and joins can limit your results. 

## [Regions Search ](region-search.md)

### 1. I have saved my genomic regions from a query - how do I upload them to the region search?

BlueGenes does not support uploading genomic regions directly from the results of an InterMine search into regions search. You first need to download the regions, and then reformat them to one of the accepted formats.
