# What is InterMine?

### Disparate data in, unified data out

InterMine is a data warehouse system that integrates biological data sources, making it easy to query and analyse data. It is an [open source](https://github.com/intermine/intermine) project that is free to use under the open source [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) license and that can be [installed on your own servers](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/) to make data available on the web.  Developed by the [Micklem lab](http://www.micklemlab.org/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/), InterMine enables the creation of biological databases accessed by sophisticated web query tools. Parsers are provided for integrating data from many common biological data sources and formats, and there is a framework for adding your own data. InterMine includes an attractive, user-friendly web interface that works ‘out of the box’ and can be easily customised for your specific needs, as well as a powerful, scriptable web-service API to allow programmatic access to your data.
