# What is InterMine?

### Disparate data in, unified data out

InterMine is a data warehouse system that integrates biological data sources, making it easy to query and analyse data. It is an [open source](https://github.com/intermine/intermine) project that is free to use under the open source [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) license and that can be [installed on your own servers](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/) to make data available on the web.
