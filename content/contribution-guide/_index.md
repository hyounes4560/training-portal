We love your contribution! We want to make contributing to this website as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug

* Proposing new features
* Writing more docs
* Becoming a maintainer

and so on.

Before you contribute, please read [InterMine Code of Conduct](http://intermine.org/code-of-conduct/#intermine-code-of-conduct)

## We develop with GitHub

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

InterMine Training Portal repository: [https://github.com/intermine/training-portal](https://github.com/intermine/training-portal)

If you are new to GitHub, [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution) will help you quick start.

## All code changes happen through pull requests

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). We actively welcome your pull requests:   
   


1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/intermine/training-portal/issues/new)

## Submit a fix

If you fix a bug, submit by [pull request](https://github.com/intermine/training-portal/issues/new)

## Propose new features

We welcome new features about the code, videos, layout, and others!

## Write more docs

If you find that some documentations are unclear, incomplete, or wrong, you can add new contents!

## Become a maintainer

Welcome! We’re excited to have you join the community. InterMine integrates biological data, but you don’t have to be a biologist to contribute to InterMine. Some of our entry-level issues only require knowledge of the relevant programming language, but others may require more in-depth understanding.
